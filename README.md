# MuSTC
This is the code used in the paper "MuSTC: A Multi-stage Spatio-Temporal Clustering Method for Highlighting the Regionality of Global SST".

- **ART** folder contains the sea surface temperature reconstruction model including a temporal encoder module, a self-attention module and two fully connected layers.
- **Cluster** folder contains the SST cluster generation module.
- **Verification** folder contains STGCN and AGCRN models that have been modified to integrate regionality information.
